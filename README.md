# disease-symptom-prediction
Prediction of Disease from the symptoms that a person has.

I have used a publicly avilable dataset from Kaggle for this Task. I have used Random Forest Search and K Nearest Neighbours to tackle the problem.
The Jypyter notebook shows a primary data anaylysis, model building and prediction. The notebook also contains a comparision of the two approaches, 
explanations fo the results and a small demo for the actual rediction of diseases by taking the symptoms as a user input.

The dataset taken from https://www.kaggle.com/itachi9604/disease-symptom-description-dataset
